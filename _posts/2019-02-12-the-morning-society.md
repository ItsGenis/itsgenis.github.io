excerpt: That morning I decided to pay attention to everything that was going on around me while walking to work.

As I step outside, the block’s main door closes behind me. I perceive the usual orange colour dyeing the city, caused by the streetlights blending with today’s dawn. I take my headphones off my pocket and start to untangle them whilst I sense the scent of the petrichor from this night’s rain drenching the air. Once I’m done with the humdrum puzzle, I plug the headphones into my phone and “nihilist blues” starts playing. Above the song’s title, my phone reminds me it’s 7:30 AM. I remind myself I have somewhere to be.

I very rarely walk to work. My lack of habit reveals itself at every turn when I hesitate about which path to take. Freed from the mandatory driving concentration, I seize the rare opportunity to observe around me while I keep perambulating the city.

I see cars racing to barely make it past the amber light and people walking in an anxious fast-paced manner in all directions. People running through crosswalks to catch the bus, yet not all of them make it, some remain panting at the stop despondently gazing at their ride disappearing in the distance. Everyone seems so wrapped in themselves, it’s almost as if I’m walking through an egotistical fair. At one point, I have to quickly get off the sidewalk to avoid getting overrun by a mother and his son in an obvious hurry, back up again and I scarcely dodge a teenager who is rapidly typing something in her phone like it’s a matter of life and death. As I get back on track — once again — I can’t help but to think about _the_ quote from The Wolf in *Pulp Fiction, *which probably is my subconscious trying to shed some humour into the matter.

> **That’s thirty minutes away. I’ll be there in ten. (Pulp Fiction, 1994)**

I turn again, and I stop to stare at an ugly graffiti. Its red letters read: “_I am the one who loves the greatest girl in this fucking world! I love you!_”. I chuckle. I’m not sure why though, is it that I feel privileged to be standing still at this very moment, or maybe that the only sign of human benevolence that I’ve found this morning is in an ugly painting on a wall?

Either way, I resume my walking. Short before I arrive at my destination, I catch a whiff of pot. In front of me there’s this young guy in a hoodie who, almost without noticing, I’ve already left behind. I internally joke about how this must be the only person in the city who is walking slower than me today.

When I finally reach to the office, instead of getting inside, I pass by. Not very far ahead there is the cafeteria, where I get in. Inside, I notice a woman in her thirties, she is drinking a take-away coffee in a hurry while searching her purse for the cash to pay. I overhear her telling the waitress that her child is waiting in the car just before she pays and leaves.

As I am about to order my usual take-away breakfast I reconsider and — just for today — decide to sit at one of the tables instead. From there, I watch how stressed people come in and out of the cafeteria while I enjoy my morning tea.
