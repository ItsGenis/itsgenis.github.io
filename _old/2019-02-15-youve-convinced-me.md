This is a post I wrote on Medium when I officially opened this blog to the public.

I’m not going to write again [what](https://medium.com/signal-v-noise/signal-v-noise-exits-medium-56c483d827fc) [others](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/) [have](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1094131716439052289) [already](https://twitter.com/progmofo/status/1095144190529466368). You should definitely check those out. And then, if you will, continue reading. But beware, what follows might not live up to expectations after the previous reads.

I like Medium. I like the simplicity of its design. I like the simplicity of its usability. And I liked the centralisation of the whole blogging community until they changed my mind. Besides, I also have concerns of my own.

I haven’t wrote much here, but I’m willing to write a lot more from now on. However, I will do it in my own personal and humble space. No comments, no claps. Just my thoughts, poured into words.

If someone stumbles upon my content, I genuinely hope they find it useful and enjoyable. But I don’t need to know. I enjoy writing in many different ways, literary when I feel creative, spitting words out as I feel them (like I’m doing now) or taking notes on whatever it is that I’m working on. Heck, I even loved writing the song lyrics for my high school band.

Writing is a rewarding self-growth experience for me, and I’m not willing to put it down just because I presume that people might not be interested.

For the very same reason that I don’t want any more claps or comments for my posts, I’m in the process of moving away from Instagram to a personal photography portfolio. No likes. No comments. I am no expert with the camera nor do I have professional equipment, I just happen to enjoy taking some pictures every now and then, and then playing around with them in Lightroom.

Too often I’ve found myself backing off from posting a picture on Instagram — after hours of editing — just because I felt it wouldn’t live up to my followers expectations. Similar feelings arise when hesitating about the worthiness of what I’m going to write next. I just want to have my own little corner of the web¹.

It wasn’t my intention to go this far, but here I am, writing — and rewriting — for two hours straight. Might be the pleasure of, well, writing.
