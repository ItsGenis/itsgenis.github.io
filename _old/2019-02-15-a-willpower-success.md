Even if you don’t need willpower advise, the psychology behind it is quite pleasing to read.

Not so long ago I decided to start reading a lot more, and that actually came with a nice anecdotal story (which I’m saving for a future post, sorry!). Today, upon finishing the second book of my _read-more_ journey, I’ve found a small wrap up exercise in its last chapter, which I’m going to take advantage of to write something (this) and hopefully set a precedent for future readings.

The title is _The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It _(McGonigal, 2011). And what the author left for its readers at the end comes as follows:

> _Has your thinking about willpower and self-control changed?_

> _Which willpower experiment was the most helpful?_

> _What was your big a-ha moment?_

> _What are you going to take with you?_

Honestly, I didn’t pick up this book because I felt like I needed to boost my willpower (actually, I think I managed to do that in a very different way, which I’m also saving for a future post, hah!) but out of curiosity for the psychological approach. This is not the classic self-help book, despite the author presenting some experiments for the readers to try out, it’s all about conclusions gathered from documented research on *why *we behave like we do in situations where willpower matters.

Has my way of thinking about willpower changed? I can safely say it has. Even though I don’t find myself acting different, whenever I now give in to some sort of temptation, my mind inevitably tries to relate it to something I’ve read in the book to answer *why. *Also, there’s one chapter where the author focuses on *neuromarketing *or, plain put, how we are being manipulated to consume stuff we don’t need. It’s crazy going out shopping after reading that chapter.

I haven’t done any of the experiments presented throughout the book, but I will admit one of them could’ve come in handy a few years ago. Back in 2014 I was completely hooked on League of Legends, and I believe anyone who has tried to climb the ladder in that game (or any other competitive game with ladders) can relate to the frustration of loss streaks and the all classic “I’m not stopping until I win one game tonight”. As the book presents it, this kind of addiction comes from the promise of a reward: our mind tricks us into believing that when we achieve whatever it is that we feel we really need, we will find happiness. The experiment encourages you to reflect on whether reality lived up to expectations, and I can assure you, it does not, you still go to bed unable to sleep.

The third question asks about the a-ha moment, or as the meme community knows it, the sudden realisation moment. For me, this appeared half-way through the book, on the chapter that speaks about how we are tempted to give in to temptation due to our inability to clearly see the future. According to the author, we treat our future selves as a complete stranger. That’s due to our inability to understand their thoughts and feelings since we don’t bring into the equation the opportunities or desires present at that moment. What I’ve come to realise is that, in the end, you are still _you _(unless you do something to change, but it’s got to be the present you).

What will I take with me? Well, I think I can be thankful to have this amount of knowledge to reflect upon, plus the ability to relate a lot of my decision making to what I’ve read here. Also, and not directly related to the book itself, one more book to my read shelf and one more post published, considering this are two things I committed to doing more, I think I can consider it a willpower success.
