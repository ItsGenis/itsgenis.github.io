This last year I’ve been watching conference talks on nearly a daily basis, the main goal of this was to stay motivated at the same time that I was getting up to date with our constant evolving environment. I’ve also attended a couple of conferences during this time, and here’s the conclusion I came up with.

The delivery of a talk is much more important than its content.

Don’t get me wrong, you don’t want to get up on stage if you don’t have anything interesting to share, but you also don’t want to make it look less interesting than it actually is by completely spoiling its delivery.

The main goal of a speaker should be to share the passion or the interest about the topic being presented.

We don’t attend talks to learn about internals or ways to do something, I think we all are proficient enough to go online and check the documentation of whatever it is you are pitching and start learning by ourselves.

Feeling motivated, though, feeling like “I should use this new stuff, because it’s \*\*\*\* amazing!” now that’s the speaker’s job.

If everything you’ve got for your delivery is reading through stuff out loud without any passion, I’m sorry, but I had enough of that at uni and I’d rather read the same in a blog post. It would save me time and probably appeal a lot more to me.
