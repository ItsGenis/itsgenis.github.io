It's about being honest.

It's about admitting your own flaws.

It's about being humble.

It's about accepting you can teach and be taught alike.

It's about maintaining composure.

It's about being critical, but tolerant.

It's about understanding not everything works out the way we expect to.

It's about communicating effectively with the team, and the client.

It's about being empathic.

It's about respecting other's space, and time, and work.

It's about being human.

It's about understanding everyone around you is human too.

It's about acting consistently.

It's about standing up for your rights, but comply with your obligations.

It's about health.

It's about knowing when to stop.

It's about the balance between physical and mental exercise.

It's about living.

It's about understanding work as life's fuel and not the other way around.

It's not about your code.
