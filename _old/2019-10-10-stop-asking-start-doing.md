I did it all my life. With whatever it was I had in mind, I kept asking myself, is this the right way to do it?

You know what? It doesn't matter. That precious time you spend going around, thinking wether your approach is optimal, could be better used in actual idea and self development. Stop thinking so much about everything and start doing.

- _"I won't be good enough"_? You will be once you get there.
- _"I'm not proficient in this required skill"_? Learn it.
- _"Someone is already doing this"_? Do it better.
- _"I don't have time"_? HAH! Maybe quit Facebook? Play less video games? Watch less TV? 99% of the people won't, so there's your head start. So start.

Rough path? Good. Less competition, especially nowadays. People want—and _only_ want—easy. How many will quit half way in? How many won't even start? If you are walking an easy road, you're doing something wrong.

You failed? Great. Stop treating failure as something bad. Failure is improvement, we should all be willing to fail. It's very naive to think there will be no bumps in the road, even if you hard planned your optimal path before. Learn from failure.

Is this the right way? Nobody knows. Not even someone who has succeeded before, there's only one person who _will_ know, and it's you. After walking it. Reached a dead-end? Walk back. Choose a different path. Start walking again.

Act. Observe. Assess. Pivot. Repeat.

It's alright to reflect upon other's stories and get inspired by them, but they're not a guide. They walked their path, they fell, they stood up. Act like them, but do so your way. Only you knows you.
