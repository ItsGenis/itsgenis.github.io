excerpt: Social platforms have completely rewired how we live our lives, we act in ways they make us, instead of acting the way we want as individuals.

Back in 2019 I deleted my Facebook account. I did it a couple of days before my birthday and it was fun seeing who actually cared and sent best wishes on the day, without the social network reminder. I'm not someone who cares about these things, but it was an interesting experiment nonetheless. Social platforms have completely rewired how we live our lives, we act in ways they make us, instead of acting the way we want as individuals.

Back then I found myself scrolling through Facebook on my phone or laptop, much more than I would like to admit, through many stuff I didn't care about. It's been a few years and I don't regret what I did at all, I've never missed it nor I had any kind of FOMO.

I still kept my Instagram, since I'm a [photographer on my free time](https://instagram.com/derrameventricular) and I could find value in it; and I kept my Twitter since it seemed like it was the place for every developer to be.

I could find value in Twitter by following experts from my day-to-day technologies at work and keeping up with the buzztalk. But again, over the years, I've been finding myself scrolling over stuff I don't care about, stuff I don't even follow, and it's been getting worse and worse. These companies don't care about what you care, they care about keeping you hooked on their site. And I'm fed up. I make my own decisions. I choose the content I want to consume. Me. Not some fucked up algorithm.

So I guess for the time being I'll keep up with what I care with newsletters, something that is curated by people who I want to hear and read.

Farewell, Twitter.
